# Architecture Audit (Go (Golang))

> **Stack Profile:** Go (Golang)  
> **Governance Standard:** OAEF v1.0.0 (Author: Felipe Carvalho)  
> **Quality Gate Policy:** Strict mathematical audit and Clean Sizing.

## Mission & Scope
Audit layer coupling, dependency direction, and architectural modularity in Go (Golang).

## Invariants
- Dependencies must point inwards towards core domain contracts.
- High-level business logic must not depend on low-level UI or database details.
- Audit file sizes and cyclomatic complexity using `Go AST parser`.

## Repository Conformance Gate
Before approving this review, run `oaef doctor` (native: `tool/governance.* doctor`) and `oaef lint`. A failing conformance or lint check blocks approval; unresolved findings MUST be recorded in `docs/wiki/memory/handoff.md` per the Inviolable Trust Hierarchy.
