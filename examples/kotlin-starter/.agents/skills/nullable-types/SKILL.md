# Nullable Types (Kotlin & Android/JVM)

> **Stack Profile:** Kotlin & Android/JVM  
> **Governance Standard:** OAEF v1.0.0 (Author: Felipe Carvalho)  
> **Quality Gate Policy:** Strict mathematical audit and Clean Sizing.

## Mission & Scope
Apply defensive, idiomatic null-safety and missing-value handling in Kotlin & Android/JVM.

## Conventions
- **Philosophy**: Null safety with smart casting and Elvis operator (?:).
- **Guard Clauses**: Validate inputs at function entrypoints and return early.
- **Zero Deep Nesting**: Replace deeply nested `if` statements with pattern matching or early exits.
- **Model Absence Explicitly**: Never use sentinel values (like -1 or empty string) when absence should be represented by null/optional.
