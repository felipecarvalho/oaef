# Collect Coverage (C# & .NET Core)

> **Stack Profile:** C# & .NET Core  
> **Governance Standard:** OAEF v1.0.0 (Author: Felipe Carvalho)  
> **Quality Gate Policy:** Strict mathematical audit and Clean Sizing.

## Mission & Scope
Execute test coverage extraction and verify mathematical compliance against `docs/wiki/metrics/baseline.json`.

## Commands
```bash
# Execute test suite with coverage instrumentation:
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=lcov

# Generated coverage report location:
coverage.info
```

## Audit Targets
- Verify line coverage is `>= 95.0%` (or above current baseline floor).
- Verify branch coverage is `>= 90.0%`.
- If coverage improved, record the new floor with the Monotonic Ratchet.
