# Architecture Audit (Swift & Apple Platforms)

> **Stack Profile:** Swift & Apple Platforms  
> **Governance Standard:** OAEF v1.0.0 (Author: Felipe Carvalho)  
> **Quality Gate Policy:** Strict mathematical audit and Clean Sizing.

## Mission & Scope
Audit layer coupling, dependency direction, and architectural modularity in Swift & Apple Platforms.

## Invariants
- Dependencies must point inwards towards core domain contracts.
- High-level business logic must not depend on low-level UI or database details.
- Audit file sizes and cyclomatic complexity using `SwiftLint metrics analyzer`.
